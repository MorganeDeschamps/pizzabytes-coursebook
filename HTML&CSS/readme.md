[HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) (HTML) is a language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML special instructions are the building blocks of web pages.

A web page is a collection of many kinds of content. This might be text, graphics, forms, audio and video files, etc. These elements live inside HTML tags. The browser uses these tags to decide how to display, order and style the content on the page.

HTML files that produce web pages are simple text files. Text is a universal way of representing data for computers; any HTML you create on a Windows PC could work on a Mac, Linux/Unix, or any other operating system.

CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the "rules" that will define the look of your webpage. Without CSS, all the pages would look as plain text and images In fact; the very first web pages in the Internet were like that.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the only languages the browser can understand, so it is really important to understand the basic rules of these stylesheets (CSS files) if we want to work efficiently with our web pages.
