During the web application development cycle, many changes occur - new features, bugs management, re-factorization of the code... Sometimes you might want to take a snapshot of the current state of the app, and it would be super useful if you could restore it to in case you made some unwanted changes you wish to remove. This all is possible - and thanks to Git.  
At the same time, web development projects usually require the effort of more than one programmer. Teams collaborate on the same projects, and not all the time, all changes synced together give the most amazing results.
How to go about this and similar challenges, you might ask? Again we have to thank to the Git. It helps us to have new releases, code that has to be organized and accessible for everyone. Git tracks changes and has a smooth and practical way of putting new code together without breaking what is already there.

**Git** is a free and open-source distributed version control system.
