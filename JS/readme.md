## What is JavaScript?

According to the official **MDN** (Mozilla Developer Network) documentation,
**JavaScript can be defined as a _lightweight_ _interpreted_ programming
language with _first-class functions_**. Sounds super scary, we know, but let's
break it down a bit:

- **_lightweight_ programming language** is any programming language that is
structured in such way to require very small memory usage while running. If you
would like to learn more about this subject, you can start
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_programming_language);
<!-- (in advanced notes: here we are talking about *runtime memory requirements* while the program executes) -->
- **_interpreted_ programming language** is any programming language that
  executes the program directly translating each line of code into
  [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm#Machine_code).
  At this very moment this is enough to know but for deeper understanding, we
  suggest you start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language);
- a **programming language with _first-class functions_** according to the MDN
  means that in this language functions are treated like any other variable and
  this being said, they can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be
  returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

To summarize this above, we can say:

- JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that gets converted into
  machine language line by line and uses functions.
- It is mostly used for Web pages (runs in browsers) but at the same time there
  are a lot of non-browser environments where it's used, such as Node.js (which
  you will learn how to use later on), among the others.

To simplify this:

- JavaScript was created to run in every browser, but now you can run JavaScript
  in your server. This means you can **create a whole application using just the
  JavaScript language**!
